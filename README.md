# API-LAB
Interaction Design

We will have to find 8 examples in 1 library.
4 of these we will expand.

WebGL- is an API for 3D graphics, we have chosen three.js as a library, because it's fun.

We thought the examples on their websites looked really good and wanted to learn more about it. 
We all did a basic tutorial for WebGL where we got to create a cube and it was spinning, so that we could understand the foundations of three.js. 

Then we each chose an example from the library and went with it:
Aziza expanded on the cube and created the moon and added space as a background. 
Liam found some cool molecules and made his own selection of molecules, he also tried to add a drop-down menu so that the user can browse through the molecules "menu".
Farbod worked with 3D text that expanded and when it gathered you can read the text, he also had fun with changing background colors and add gradients. 
Monica found a dancing character and tried to change it to a dancing stormtrooper. 

We each worked on our own examples but mostly during group meetings so that we could talk and help each other, so I guess to some extent we're all aware of the challenges the others faced. 
We didn't intent to work with different features, but it sort of happened and this sort of forced us to become more aware of how complex WebGL can be.
