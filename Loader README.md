this example creates a scene and uses camera and lights. 
it has an fbx character that dances and the original one was replaced by a dancing stormtrooper. 
the problem is that the mesh of the stormtrooper isn't loading and because of that we can't use .scale to make it bigger.
one way around it was to move the camera closer to the dancing guy. 
some of the code connected to this is at least one js script that "translates" the fbx file so that it's uploaded.
